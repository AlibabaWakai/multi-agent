## ðŸŒŸ How It Works

The system takes in inputs like **resumes, GitHub profiles, and personal websites**, processes them using AI agents, and produces tailored resumes and interview Q&A to maximize job application success.

### **ðŸ”¹ Agents & Responsibilities**
1. **Job Researcher** â€“ Extracts key skills and qualifications from job postings.
2. **Personal Profiler** â€“ Analyzes the candidateâ€™s strengths from various online sources.
3. **Resume Strategist** â€“ Customizes resumes based on the extracted insights.
4. **Interview Coach** â€“ Generates key Q&A for interview preparation.

Each agent works in collaboration under a **Crew Manager LLM**, ensuring a structured workflow.
